A quick and not-comprehensive of some of my reading so far:

1. "State of the Field..." (2011.09570)
    - Tom does two things here: perform hierarchical inference for $\chi_{\rm eff}$ (based on underlying kick distribution), and identify tension between large kick velocity dispersions and existing theory/EM observations
    - Population model: Distribution of $\chi_{\rm eff}$ for those binaries that survive and merge (using Kalogera 1996 prescription) implied by Monte Carlo simulations of BH-He star binaries. He makes some simplifying assumptions --- for example, that the BH mass is drawn from a fixed (i.e. not varied during inference) powerlaw and that 90% of the He star mass is lost.
    - He finds that extreme values of the velocity dispersion ($\sim 10^3$ km / s) are required to fit the implied chieff distribution...although he does fix the BBH mass and redshift distributions during inference.
    - Comparison to theory/other observation:
      - He does an order-of-magnitude estimate for the fraction of stellar binaries that end up producing BBH which merger in a Hubble time (~$10^{-4}$)
      - Since this fraction will change (specifically decrease!) as you increase the kick dispersion velocity, you can ask questions like "How many binaries must survive the first supernova, in order to accommodate that so many/few survive later on given a small/large typical kick velocity and still be consistent w/ GW observations?"
      - In turn, you can determine whether those accommodations come in tension with EM observations or other theory.


2. "Revising the Spin and Kick Connection in Isolated Binary Black Holes" (2412.03461) (A shorter summary than one I previous sent, to triple-check there wasn't overlap)
    - They study the impact of non-standard prescriptions for spin-orbit misalignment, namely:that the compact object spin is either parallel or perpendicular to the kick vector
	  - With Monte Carlo simulation, they show these prescriptions --- alongside some fixed assumptions about the binary progneitors/evolution --- can produce cosine-tilt distributions which peak away from 1, and which are *also* not isotropic.
	  - While they compare cosine-tilt distributions under non-standard prescriptions to those distributions under the standard prescription, they *don't* explicitly show that the standard prescriptions fail to produce peaks away from 1.
  

Works by Tauris in 2022 & a follow-up in 2025 are closer to Tom's paper ... they do some straightfoward (i.e. not full pop. synth) Monte Carlo simulations to understand the impact of the kick distribution on the $\chi_{\rm eff}$, and then compare those to the LVK's inferred $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution.
So, I think there (still!) remains work for us to do, focusing both on the spin-tilts in particular, showing that standard pop-snyth _can't_ produce peaks away from 1, and performing inference coupled w/ an injection campaign to see what we find w/ GWTC-4.
